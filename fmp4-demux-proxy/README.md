# fmp4-demux-proxy

An optional service for Stitch that separates Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting audio and video samples without transcoding. **Docker is optional.** You can run the same Python service directly on a computer reachable from your Roku.

Roku supports HLS CMAF with separate audio and video renditions; it does not support combined audio/video CMAF. The relevant Twitch streams bundle both tracks. Splitting those tracks addresses the error-970/silent-audio packaging problem while preserving video quality. Ordinary compatible streams bypass the service. The service does not make an unsupported codec playable, and 1440p/low-latency results still require Roku hardware verification.

## Run without Docker

From this directory, with Python 3.12+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv sync --locked --no-dev
uv run --locked python -m fmp4_demux_proxy
```

The server listens on port 8080. To load your configuration from a file, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and run:

```bash
uv run --locked --env-file .env python -m fmp4_demux_proxy
```

You can also install with `python -m pip install .` inside a virtual environment, then run `python -m fmp4_demux_proxy`. The uv path uses the checked-in dependency lock.

In **Stitch → Settings → Proxy URL**, enter an address reachable from the Roku, such as `http://192.168.1.50:8080`. The computer must remain running while a stream uses the service. `localhost` in the Roku setting refers to the Roku itself. Allow the listening port through the computer's local firewall.

Verify setup with `http://192.168.1.50:8080/health`; the response contains `"status":"ok"`. Leave Proxy URL empty when you do not need the service.

## Run with Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

Compose passes supported settings from `.env` and uses a read-only filesystem, nonroot user, no Linux capabilities, and memory/process limits. The image uses Python 3.14 and a digest-pinned uv installer with locked production dependencies.

Published images use `ghcr.io/narehood/fmp4-demux-proxy:main`. That tag reflects published main, so it may predate a pending modernization PR. Build the checkout to exercise its changes.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| PORT | 8080 | Listening port |
| LOG_LEVEL | INFO | Application log level |
| PROXY_PUBLIC_URL | Request scheme and Host | Base URL reachable by Roku; set explicitly behind a reverse proxy or when port/path mapping changes it |
| UPSTREAM_HOST_ALLOWLIST | ttvnw.net,twitch.tv,twitchcdn.net | Permitted upstream domain suffixes; enforced before every redirect |
| UPSTREAM_CONNECT_TIMEOUT | 5 | Connection deadline in seconds |
| UPSTREAM_READ_TIMEOUT | 30 | Read inactivity deadline in seconds |
| UPSTREAM_TOTAL_TIMEOUT | 45 | Deadline including queueing, redirect chain and response body |
| MAX_MANIFEST_BYTES | 2097152 | Maximum upstream playlist bytes; rewritten playlists are capped at four times this |
| MAX_SEGMENT_BYTES | 33554432 | Maximum upstream segment or init bytes |
| SEGMENT_CACHE_BYTES | 134217728 | Shared upstream cache byte limit; also capped at 50 entries |
| MAX_UPSTREAM_CONCURRENCY | 8 | Concurrent upstream fetches |
| MAX_INFLIGHT_REQUESTS | 64 | Concurrent admitted requests; excess traffic receives 503 |
| ALLOW_UNSAFE_UPSTREAM | false | Explicit development-only override for private/local addresses and an empty host allowlist |

All limits must be positive and finite. Private, loopback, link-local and other non-global IPs are blocked by default, including DNS answers and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses. The connector uses the validated DNS results directly. `ALLOW_UNSAFE_UPSTREAM` is deliberately absent from Compose's production environment.

Forwarded Host/Proto headers are ignored. Set `PROXY_PUBLIC_URL` to the correct HTTP(S) URL when using a reverse proxy. Signed upstream URLs and query strings are omitted from application/access logs; configure your reverse proxy to omit them too.

The service has no authentication. Keep it on a trusted LAN or put authenticated access/firewall rules in front of it. A populated host allowlist limits upstream destinations, but is not access control for clients.

## Playback and API behavior

- `GET /m3u8?u=<URL>` accepts a playlist. A bundled fMP4 variant becomes a master with separate audio/video. A direct variant's init is inspected first; already-separated CMAF or TS remains an ordinary media playlist.
- Codec, bandwidth and resolution hints use `codecs`, `bw`, and `res`. Supply the original master metadata for HEVC/1440p. Unknown codec hints are omitted, rather than replaced with a guessed AVC codec/profile.
- Master playlists retain existing external audio/subtitle relationships. Verified bundled CMAF entries gain separate audio/video media playlists; a video rendition that still contains embedded audio is split while preserving any declared external audio group. CODECS alone never determines the container: native TS also advertises AVC and AAC.
- `variant=<absolute URL>` filters a master to one exact entry. `variants=<JSON array of absolute URLs>` filters an automatic ladder. Selections must match the upstream master, contain 1–32 distinct URLs, and fit within 32 KiB decoded JSON.
- `demuxVariants=<JSON array of verified bundled URLs>` identifies the selected entries requiring demux. Use `[]` for native TS. The list must be a subset of selected entries and contain at most 32 URLs / 32 KiB decoded JSON. When omitted, the service inspects selected variant/init data with bounded concurrency and a whole-request deadline; providing verified format information avoids duplicate probing.
- The server accepts request lines up to 64 KiB to accommodate signed variant lists. A reverse proxy must allow corresponding URI sizes; otherwise it may reject automatic-quality requests before they reach this service.
- Internal `/s` links carry exact init URL (`i`), source range (`r=length@offset`), and init range (`ir`). Every media request resolves its own init. Request order, directory layout, cache eviction and discontinuity track-ID changes do not determine the track map.
- Audio/video consumers coalesce upstream requests. Init and media output contain only the requested track, remapped to track ID 1. Missing tracks or unsupported sample addressing return a clear error; original combined bytes are never returned as a separated rendition.
- Explicit and valid implicit source byte ranges are fetched and verified as HTTP 206 ranges. Their playlist tags are removed because the output is a separate resource. Client Range headers apply to the rewritten output, independently of source offsets.
- LL-HLS part/preload/rendition-report links and bounded blocking-reload parameters are preserved. This does not establish Roku LL-HLS support or guarantee a lower playback delay.

## Troubleshooting and limits

A 400 response can indicate an invalid URL, host policy, track, or missing init reference. A 502 indicates upstream failure/oversized input, unavailable tracks, unsupported addressing or a malformed manifest. A 504 indicates the whole-request deadline expired. A 503 means the service is busy; try again shortly.

Do not disable the allowlist to repair a new CDN hostname. Verify the actual stream host and add only the necessary trusted hostname/suffix. Additional historical VOD CDNs still need captured-stream verification.

Demux currently supports unencrypted fragments with movie-fragment-relative addressing, explicit sample-run offsets and resolvable sample sizes. Absolute/implicit fragment addressing, encrypted combined fragments, and open-ended preload ranges fail explicitly. A CDN that ignores a requested source byte range is also rejected. These constraints need captured-stream evidence before the splitter is extended.

A passing health check proves the service is reachable, not that a Roku can decode a selected stream. Confirm picture, audible audio, quality changes, VOD seeking and sustained playback on the target device.

## Development

```bash
uv sync --locked --all-extras
uv run --locked ruff check src tests
uv run --locked ruff format --check src tests
uv run --locked pytest
uv export --locked --no-dev --no-emit-project --output-file runtime-requirements.txt
uvx pip-audit==2.10.1 --disable-pip --require-hashes --strict -r runtime-requirements.txt
docker build -t fmp4-demux-proxy .
```

Tests use synthetic MP4 samples and local fixture servers with explicit unsafe configuration. No Twitch/Roku credentials or signed production streams are needed. Container build/health checks run in CI; the development machine used for this modernization has no Docker CLI.
